				 	Bahamas is a coral-based archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean. Its 700-plus islands and cays range from uninhabited to packed with resorts. The northernmost, Grand Bahama, and Paradise Island, home to many large-scale hotels, are among the best known. Scuba diving and snorkeling sites include the massive Andros Barrier Reef, Thunderball Grotto (used in James Bond films) and the black-coral gardens off Bimini. we recomend <a href="https://atlantisbahamas.com/specials?gclid=Cj0KCQjwy9LVBRDOARIsAGqoVnutjunjcXby-YncFAzvdqDuVxTutxO7BWBX-zzOCFMQNwPZF99XHvQaAhXAEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">atlantis</a> as a hotel to keep in mind.

					Greece is a country in southeastern Europe with thousands of islands throughout the Aegean and Ionian seas. Influential in ancient times, it's often called the cradle of Western civilization. Athens, its capital, retains landmarks including the 5th-century B.C. Acropolis citadel with the Parthenon temple. Greece is also known for its beaches, from the black sands of Santorini to the party resorts of Mykonos. we recomend <a href="http://www.royalolympic.com/">Royal</a> Olympic Hotel as a hotel to keep in mind.
